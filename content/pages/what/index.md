Remote hackathons and other ways that the tech industry has responded to the Covid pandemic have been great for keeping us all productive over this time.

What we have however missed out on is place based community, and Hack the Lakes is a tentative plan to bring that back based in a tiny corner of the Lake District.

Scratch the surface of any part of this area and you find the birthplace of ideas that shaped our world.

The event will give space and provide inspiration to explore technology that solves today's problems. We aim to put a mixture of technologists and problem owners in an area in the heart of the Lake District for a few weeks over summer, spend time together to generate meaningful and sustainable prototype technology solutions.

--------

We are planning to:

 1. Pick some specific goals  in local and global challenge areas of supporting environmentally and socially sustainable community.

 2. Engage problem owners, creative thinkers, experienced and new developers at a curated hack camp over several summer weeks in an inspiring environment.

 3. This is holiday time so make it fun and inspirational for everyone that shares their time with us. Aim is to inspire and unleash creativity, not do stuff that feels like work. Lots of on and offsite recreational opportunities.

 4. Create prototype solutions almost as a bi-product.
