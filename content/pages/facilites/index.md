For a pilot in 2022 we have use of a 10-acre site for up to 4 weeks, and this will be the HQ for the event. It will have WiFi, electricity, toilets, and showers as well as a covered space to work together and create.
Onsite accomodation will be based on bringing your own tent and camping on the site. We realise this won't suit everyone, and, if you wish to arrange your own holiday accommodation locally, it will be possible to participate fully and we will do our best to facilitate this.

Looking ahead, if we do run a full event in 2023, and with advance booking we should be able to to provide a range of accommodation from "bunkhouse" shared facilities through to family holiday cottages in the locality.

# Connectivity

Good connectivity is key to any tech event and, when we started planning this event and location, a key driving factor were the advanced plans that [B4RN](https://b4rn.org.uk) had to provide symmetric Gigabit fibre broadband to the location and area.
Sadly in the last month it has become clear that this has been scuppered by DCMS who have withdrawn the Project Gigabit voucher support for the area and placed it into the first round regional procurement. This probably means we won't have B4RN connectivity either at all, or until 2023 at the earliest if the area is re-established as a Voucher Priority Area in summer 2022. If this doesn't happen then we will likely have to buy Internet transit for the site on an Openreach EAD tail. This shouldn't be too difficult or expensive as there is BT fibre in ducting that runs across one corner of the site. It is however, unlike B4RN, a fairly serious expense for which we would need to obtain outside sponsorship or donations.

For the 2022, the EAD may not be in place, depending on funding and build times and we may have to make do with likely multiple bonded 80/20 FTTC circuits to provide cheap and cheerful Internet access for the pilot attendees. Any FTTC circuits we order will at least run at full line speed as the cabinet is at a corner of the site. We also have a [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) on order, and this should be interesting to work with as it may be the only connectivity which is available in the deployment environment for some of the rural technology we may be working on.
