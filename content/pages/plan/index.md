We've been actively exploring this idea since the early part of the Covid crisis in the UK. It seems to be a really good way of bringing back face to face creativity and community when it is safe and prudent to do so.

We think now is the time to start testing the Hack the Lakes plans.

<!-- end excerpt -->

2020 and 2021 weren't the right time to bootstrap this thing due to uncertainties about the Covid situation. We think the best current plan is to start building some momentum through 2022 with a pilot next summer leading to an initial full event in 2023. Covid is still a huge elephant somewhat obscuring the room, and we need to be sensible in this respect, but we also need to start making some headway so...

## What we need to do

- [ ] Engage with communities of benefit and validate the concept: will technical community attend, will local community want to support and provide challenges?
- [ ] If yes, then we need a corporate structure to steer the event, under management of both communities. 
- [ ] Plan for a very low impact _and survivable_ 2022 pilot. 
  - Small number of people who are well engaged with aims and objectives: enthusiasts
  - Free to attendees for basic camping, although some offsite activities may incur costs payable direct to provider.
  - No huge commitment, can seed without vast cash investment
  - If Covid messes with us then we will react and adapt
  - Working with invited local community stakeholders to pitch capabilities, ideas, benefits
  - Dry run, what will work, what won't
- [ ] Review, reflect, plan for real thing in 2023!

## How to contribute

Right now, this is the vision of one person. To succeed, it need to become a community curated event. We intend to run it on the lines of an Open Source Project, this means that:
 * Anyone can contribute, within a robust and inclusive vision supported by a strong code of conduct.
 * The goal is community benefit, for both the local communities in the area around Hack the Lakes, and global Open Source projects.

This website is in a public repo at https://github.com/aplisay/hackthelakes the subset of folks interested in the project who are comfortable doing so are encouraged to send pull requests to contribute, and raise issues to communicate work that needs doing. 

Everyone with an interest is encouraged to get in touch, give us feedback, and tell us about your ideas or possible contributions using one of the options in the bottom section of this page.

The following input is especially important as we asses the viability of the pilot:

 * Individual open source contributors who would like to come and be resident for all or part of Hack the Lakes in the pilot year
 * Projects who want to support us
 * Local organisations within Cumbria that have a problem they would like us to work on, or could offer logistical, or just moral support to the project
 * Sponsors and supporters who would like to contribute materially to the project - see the [Facilities page](/facilities) for more info about what is pressing here, especially with respect to connectivity

As soon as we have sufficient support and confidence to press the go button on a pilot year, forming a CIC to be the overarching legal entity for *Hack the Lakes* will become a priority and we envisage the steering board of this will be drawn from individuals and organisations engaged in the first few categories above.
