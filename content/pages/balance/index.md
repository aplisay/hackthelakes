Traditional tech hackathons are typically 2-3 days and based on focussed "macho" short cycle prototype development.
Our vision for HTL is so much more than this. We want to create relaxing and recharging environment for all participants.
We will create a rich programme of optional visits to derive inspiration from the rich surrounding area. We want to make the whole event enjoyable for technologists, and anyone they choose to accompany them. 
Families will be welcome, and participation in creating stuff optional.
