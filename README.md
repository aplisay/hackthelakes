# Hack the Lakes Website

This repo is a horrible hack of a website about a great idea. 

## Contributing

All of the content and site images sit in markdown files in directories under `/content`. The format of these is undocumented **TODO** but somewhat obvious. Please raise issues on the project and/or send PRs,

## Technology and licence

The site was built by rjp44 using gatsby-starter-landed which I ported from Gatsby V2 to Gatsby V4, in part to learn Gatsby. 

It is using a licenced copy of the [Landed](https://html5up.net/) HTML5 template, but you may copy it provided any derived work carries their CC Attribution 3.0 statement.

All of the rjp44/Hack the Lakes/Aplisay code is licened under a 2 clause BSD licence. This is with the exception of the high res photos. These are all Copyright Rob Pickering except for the train picture `oxenholme.jpg` which is Copyright Andrew Abbot CC SA 2.0 as noted in the bottom corner overlay.
